2. **Data Quality:** 52.3% zero-bet transactions requiring investigation
3. **Player Risk:** 15,437 players at high churn risk
4. **Revenue:** $24.8M daily average with detailed breakdown by game/player

## 🔧 Technical Implementations

### Data Pipeline
- **ETL Process:** Chunked CSV loading (50k records/batch)
- **Performance:** 16.2M records loaded in 45 minutes
- **Optimization:** 35% storage reduction through data type optimization

### Dashboard Features
- **Real-time KPIs:** Revenue, players, house edge, ARPU
- **Time Filtering:** All time, 30 days, 7 days, custom ranges
- **Interactive Charts:** Revenue trends, game performance, player analytics
- **Advanced Analytics:** Player segmentation, churn prediction, risk management

### Performance Optimizations
- **Caching:** Multi-level caching strategy (5-10 minute TTL)
- **Query Optimization:** Proper indexing, CTEs, window functions
- **Lazy Loading:** Dashboard components load on-demand
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-friendly interface

## 🔍 Key Technical Solutions

### Challenge: Time Filter Not Working
**Problem:** Dashboard metrics were fixed to specific time periods
**Solution:** Refactored all data loading functions to accept time_period parameter
```python
def load_kpi_data(time_period):
    # Dynamic SQL generation based on time filter
    return apply_time_filter_to_kpi(base_query, time_period)
```

### Challenge: Large Dataset Performance
**Problem:** 16M+ records causing slow response
**Solution:** Intelligent caching and query optimization
- Database indexing on key columns
- Streamlit @st.cache_data decorators
- Optimized SQL with proper WHERE clauses

### Challenge: Production Deployment
**Problem:** Virtual environment and dependency issues
**Solution:** Clean project structure and containerization
- Removed 25+ unnecessary development files
- Created production-ready structure
- Docker configuration for cloud deployment
